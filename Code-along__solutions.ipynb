    "Before we get started... (adapted from David Dempsey's [Python for Geoscientists](https://github.com/ddempsey/python_for_geoscientists) course)\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing computer code, there are *rules* and there are *conventions*.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you break a __\\*rule\\*__, the code will not work.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you break a __\\*convention\\*__, someone, somewhere puts a mark against your name in a book. At the end of times, there will be a final accounting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some Python rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __\\*Syntax\\*__ - we have very precise expectations about how you write computer code. If you type an opening a bracket, you must close it again later. Some lines must be terminated by a colon, - if you omit this, the code will not work. __\\*Learning syntax for a new code is very pedantic and a total pain.\\*__ But you have to do it anyway, and at least Python returns readable error messages to help you understand your missteps...\n",
    "- __\\*Indentation\\*__ - Python reads indentation (not all languages do) and your code will not work if it is not correctly indented. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some Python conventions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __\\*Commenting\\*__ - it is helpful for the poor soul who has to read your poorly written Python (sometimes that is you, weeks or months later) if you have included little 'sign-posts' in the code, articulating what you are doing. These are called comments. They begin with a # symbol, after which you can write whatever you like and it will not be executed as a command.\n",
    "- __\\*Sensible variable names\\*__ - relating to the thing the variable represents but not too long. For example, if a variable contains the mean temperature, then Tmean is a sensible variable name, where as the_mean_temperature_of_the_profile or a1 are not sensible variable names. \n",
    "- __\\*Layout\\*__ - Although the computer reads Python line-by-line, using a vertical layout improves the human readability and your ability to comment code. Headings and the liberal use of whitespace improves readbility. \n",
    "- __\\*Structure\\*__ - Python files and projects have a standard structure that improves redabality. The structure of files vary, but all files should start with an explanation of what they do and all packages/modules should be imported at the top. For the advanced folks, more on Python project structure can be found [here](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/structure/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Units are a common source of error. Approches to managing this include:\n",
    "- Include units in the variable names (my preferred) `Tmean_degC = 300`\n",
    "- Include in-line comments on units and conversions used (good, but can be lost information) `Tmean = 300 # mean temp in degC`\n",
    "- Consider tools like [Pint](https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to manage units, if it is a large problem (good, but assumes everyone knows how to use pint)"
