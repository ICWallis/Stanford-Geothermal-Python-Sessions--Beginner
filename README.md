# Stanford Geothermal Python Sessions -- Beginner

## Pain Reduction

The goal is to provide enough foundation to reduce the frustration of getting started. Learning to code can often feel as futile as picking apart cold spaghetti. 

- What is Python and why would people learn it
- Structure: Anaconda, conda, code, code editors (most popular)
- import fly
- Examples: from chem, geophysics, geology, and reservior -- pre-primed code-along
- Running python: in command prompt, from a txt file (.py), in a jupyter notebook 
- Error reading, using the internets. Print debugging.
- Code-along example of building up a bit of code (a plot) non-linear and google some things
- A wee code problem to solve - learning by doing is the best way to learn. Find a wee problem to solve, a calculation, plotting or data handling task. https://automatetheboringstuff.com/  
- Commenting, for future you and others
- On-line (and other) resources for
    1. learning to code
    2. looking up what a particular method does (docs, a big part of coding package knowledge)
    3. Blog posts vs stack overflow vs docs
- Easter egg - zen of python, conventions and syntax
- Find your community - SWUNG, work friend, hackathons etc coding is a social activity. Talking and reading about coding helps.
- Reality check (10 years to learn to code, but useful within a few months)
